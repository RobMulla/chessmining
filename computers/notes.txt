Can't get ratings details directly from FICS

Details available only for human viewing on website

Manually retrieved computer list from FICS website by doing "help computer_list"

Ran a finger on each one of the computer accounts, by running curl on
the FICSgames website.


Finger of each can have details like author comments, had to clean it
up. Using perl and command line.

Even then the information is not in CSV or any other palatable format.

Some computers haven't even played rated games, because they are still being experiemented upon. These computers were ignored.
