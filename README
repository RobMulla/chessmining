DATA MINING CHESS GAMES
-----------------------

The Free Internet Chess Server (FICS) 1 maintains an extensive set of
chess games in its database. The data set contains games from 1999 to
2011 and in- cludes players of all kinds of ratings â€“ from the very
beginner, to grand masters, to computers. Apart from the traditional
chess games, people also play chess variants on the server. For
example: suicide chess, losers, crazyhouse etc. The data for each game
is captured as a Portable Game Notation (PGN) [13] file and contains
information regarding the moves played, the players names, their
rating, time controls used and the result.  As of this writing the
FICS chess database contains game records for over 130,000,000 chess
games, played by over 300,000 humans and 1,400 computers.  This
project aims at finding interesting patterns in the FICS chess data
set.


SOURCE CODE 
-----------

computers/ - CSV files related to computer data. Includes computer
	     game statistics information and data required for
	     frequent pattern mining.

humans/  -   CSV files related to human data. Includes human game
	     statistics and data required to calculate open- ing
	     frequencies.

R/ 	 -   R source which was used to perform data analysis
   	     and visualization.

scripts/ -   Perl, Python and shell scripts used to extract and
	     cleanse data.

tex/     -   LaTeX source which was used to generate the reports.


Running the make command while within the humans and computers direc-
tories will generate all the CSV data from the raw data. It will also
invoke the script which fetches the player statistics data from the
FICS server and may take some time. 

NOTE: This distribution does not include the raw PGN files which were
used to create the CSV files. This was done because they were really
huge. You can contact the author to obtain the PGN files.
